                <p> As a Bachelor's candidate in Computer Science at The University of Texas at Arlington, my academic pursuits are characterized by 
                    a strong focus on cybersecurity and software development. In my most recent role as an Undergraduate Student Researcher, I delved 
                    into integrating Large Language Models to enhance tools for detecting zero-day vulnerabilities, a project that culminated in a co-authored publication.

                    Our team applied this cutting-edge research by analyzing documented CVEs for memory-related vulnerabilities, leading to the development of 
                    automation scripts that interfaced with symbolic execution tools. With certifications in cybersecurity from Google, I aim to leverage my expertise to 
                    contribute to secure and robust software solutions.</p>

                    <p> As part of a 4-person Agile team, I developed an Android recipe recommendation app using Java and Firebase.
                         This app suggests dishes to users based on the ingredients they have available. I actively contributed to the
                         front-end UI design and implemented interactive graphs and charts using Chart.js to visually represent
                         macronutrient breakdowns and other dietary information. I successfully overcame challenges to ensure
