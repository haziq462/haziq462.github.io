                <p> As a Bachelor's graduate in Computer Science at The University of Texas at Arlington, my academic pursuits are characterized by 
                    a strong focus on cybersecurity and software development. I'm currently working as a Software Analyst at Paycom, where I utilize SQL and PHP to navigate large databases 
                    and generate data fixes to resolve issues interrupting the payroll process. 

                    In my previous role as an Undergraduate Student Researcher, I delved into integrating Large Language Models to enhance tools for detecting zero-day vulnerabilities, a project that culminated in a co-authored publication.
                     Our small team applied cutting-edge research 
                    by analyzing documented CVEs for memory-related vulnerabilities, leading to the development of 
                    automation scripts that interfaced with symbolic execution tools. With certifications in cybersecurity from Google, I aim to leverage my expertise to 
                    contribute to secure and robust software solutions.</p>
